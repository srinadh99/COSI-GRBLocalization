# ComptonNet
These notebooks present preliminary experiments on GRB localization using an unbinned analysis of raw features from the Compton data space—energy, φ (phi), χ (chi), ψ (psi), and distance. Performance is reported via angular deviation (mean and median). We evaluate Deep Sets (well-suited for permutation-invariant event sets) and Set Transformers. In parallel, we are exploring a binned approach that constructs 3D histograms over the angular features (φ, χ, ψ) and trains 3D CNNs for localization. Our goal is an ML-based GRB localization tool that is faster than current TS-map pipelines, enabling quicker, more precise follow-up by optical and infrared surveys.
